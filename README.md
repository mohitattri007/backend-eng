# Backend Engineering Fundamentals – Networking & Protocols (Python)

## Overview
This repository contains hands-on backend engineering projects focused on networking and communication fundamentals. The goal is to understand how backend systems work beneath frameworks by implementing core protocols from scratch using Python.

The projects cover TCP, UDP, HTTP, TLS, WebSockets, and WebRTC, with emphasis on data flow, reliability, security, latency, and failure modes that shape real-world backend systems.

## Why This Repo
Modern backend development often hides networking complexity behind frameworks. This repository focuses on what those abstractions hide, helping build stronger intuition for transport vs application layer responsibilities, protocol guarantees and trade-offs, real-time communication, and secure data transmission.

These fundamentals are critical for scalable APIs, distributed systems, and GenAI platforms.

Each project is self-contained and documents the protocol layer involved, implementation approach, limitations, and real-world use cases.

## Tech Stack
Python 3, socket programming, async I/O, TLS, and minimal standard-library-based implementations.

## Learning Path
TCP → UDP → HTTP → REST → TLS → WebSockets → WebRTC
